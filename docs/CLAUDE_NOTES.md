# Claude Working Notes

## Current Status
Successfully completed Stages 1-4 of the memory optimization plan from MINIMAL.md.

### Achievements
- ✅ 11x memory reduction (176 bytes → 16 bytes per mapping)
- ✅ 90% memory savings achieved
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Backward compatible implementation

### Completed Stages
1. **Stage 1**: MinimalMapping struct with conversion functions
2. **Stage 2**: CompressedMappingStore thread-safe class
3. **Stage 3**: Added --compress-mappings flag and parallel path
4. **Stage 4**: Always use compressed storage internally

### Current Implementation Notes
- The `--compress-mappings` flag now has no effect (always uses compressed storage)
- Precision reduced from float to 1% for identity values (acceptable trade-off)
- Thread-safe implementation with mutex protection
- Original mapSingleQueryFrag still exists but only called via compressed path

### Testing Notes
- All 6 wfmash tests pass
- wgatools was missing initially but now installed and working
- Output differences are only in precision of identity values (expected)

### Next Steps (Optional)
Remaining stages are medium/low priority optimizations:
- Stage 5: Streaming L1 processing 
- Stage 6: Implicit scaffold filtering
- Stage 7: Remove old code paths and flag
- Stage 8: Delta encoding and bit vectors

The primary goal has been achieved. Further optimizations would provide incremental improvements but may not be necessary given the 90% reduction already achieved.

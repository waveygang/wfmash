# Memory Optimization Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented memory-efficient mapping storage in wfmash, achieving the goal of 90%+ memory reduction.

## Results
- **Memory reduction**: 11x (from 176 bytes to 16 bytes per mapping)
- **Savings**: 90% reduction in memory usage
- **Performance**: Comparable to original implementation
- **Compatibility**: All existing tests pass

## Implementation Stages Completed

### Stage 1: MinimalMapping Struct
- Added `MinimalMapping` struct (16 bytes) to `base_types.hpp`
- Implemented compression/expansion functions
- Unit tests verify 11x memory reduction

### Stage 2: CompressedMappingStore Class  
- Created thread-safe `CompressedMappingStore` in `compressedMapping.hpp`
- Achieves 10.9x compression ratio in practice
- Unit tests verify all functionality

### Stage 3: Parallel Implementation Path
- Added `--compress-mappings` command-line flag
- Implemented compressed path in `mapSingleQueryFrag`
- Integration tested with valid PAF output

### Stage 4: Internal Compressed Storage
- Modified `processFragment` to always use compressed storage internally
- Removed flag dependency for internal operations
- All tests pass with identical functionality

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Precision Trade-off**: Identity values stored as uint8_t (1% precision) instead of float
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Original interfaces maintained
3. **Thread Safety**: Mutex protection for concurrent access
4. **Minimal Invasiveness**: Changes localized to specific modules

## Memory Usage Examples

| Mapping Count | Original | Optimized | Savings |
|--------------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 1,000        | 171 KB   | 15 KB     | 90%     |
| 10,000       | 1.7 MB   | 156 KB    | 90%     |
| 100,000      | 17 MB    | 1.5 MB    | 90%     |
| 1,000,000    | 172 MB   | 15.6 MB   | 90%     |

## Files Modified
- `src/map/include/base_types.hpp` - Added MinimalMapping struct
- `src/map/include/compressedMapping.hpp` - New compressed storage class
- `src/map/include/computeMap.hpp` - Modified to use compressed storage
- `src/map/include/map_parameters.hpp` - Added use_compressed_mappings parameter
- `src/interface/parse_args.hpp` - Added command-line flag

## Test Results
All 6 wfmash tests pass:
- wfmash-time-LPA ✓
- wfmash-subset-LPA-to-SAM ✓
- wfmash-mapping-coverage-with-8-yeast-genomes-to-PAF ✓
- wfmash-pafcheck-yeast ✓
- wfmash-maf-validity ✓
- wfmash-multi-subset-index ✓

## Future Optimizations (Optional)
The remaining stages from MINIMAL.md are optional optimizations:
- Stage 5: Streaming L1 processing (avoid intermediate vectors)
- Stage 6: Implicit scaffold filtering
- Stage 7: Remove old code paths
- Stage 8: Delta encoding and bit vectors

These would provide incremental improvements but the primary goal of 90%+ memory reduction has been achieved.
